Types of binary trees:

1) Full Binary tree - All the nodes should have either 0 or 2 children
2) Complete Binary Trees - All levels are completely filled except the last level and last level has all nodes as left as possible
3) Perfect Binary Trees - All leaf nodes are in the same level
4) Balanced Bianry Trees - Height of the tree can be at a maximum of log(N), if no of nodes is 8 then at max the height should be 3
5) Degenerate Trees - It's a tree in which every node has one children (linked list)
