Types of binary trees:

1) Full Binary tree - All the nodes should have either 0 or 2 children
2) Complete Binary Trees - All levels are completely filled except the last level and last level has all nodes as left as possible
3) Perfect Binary Trees - All leaf nodes are in the same level
4) Balanced Bianry Trees - Height of the tree can be at a maximum of log(N), if no of nodes is 8 then at max the height should be 3
5) Degenerate Trees - It's a tree in which every node has one children (linked list)

Traversals in Binary Trees:

             1
      2              3
  4       5      6       7

DFS:
1) Inorder Traversal(Root will be IN i.e, Middle) = LEFT ROOT RIGHT (4 2 5 1 6 3 7)
2) Pre Order Traversal(Root will be PRE i.e, First) = ROOT LEFT RIGHT (1 2 4 5 3 6 7)
3) Post Order Traversal(Root will be POST i.e, LAST) = LEFT RIGHT ROOT (4 5 2 6 7 3 1)


BFS:
1) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - Goes level wise
